# Wicca Framework
Is the culmination of my work building a framework for my actionscript 3 projects over the years. It's based on the brilliant MVCExpress framework and fully supports Starling rendering. Gives you lots of nice stuff and makes it easy to setup a new game project. It's based around the concept of "packages" which are encapsulated pieces of functionality that handles different aspects of your application. There are a few packages supplied with the framework, for example, loading assets from WIC archive files and handling game states etc.

Since all the uncertaintly about flash erupted I have (sadly) been moving away more and more from the flash community and thusly Actionscript programming.
